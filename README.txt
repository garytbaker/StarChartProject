This is the SkyCharts README file.

This was trested in android studio on the 4.7 WXGA API 23 API.

None of the Star Charts are of my own creation. They were taken from WhatsOutTonight.com and then I photoshoped it to only contain the SkyChart.

Everything is contained within the app so it should be ready to build and run. I hope you enjoy!
