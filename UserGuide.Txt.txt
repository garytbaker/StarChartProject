SkyCharts User Guide

Upon opening the application you will arrive at the main page. This is the menu with a 4x3 grid of buttons labeled for each month. 
Click on the month whose star chart you would like to view.
After you click on the month, It will take you to the designated star chart's month page.
Here there are three things, a back button in the top left corner, the star chart, and a sliding bar on the bottom.
To use a star chart, you align the direction that you are looking at to the bottom of the chart.
You can use the sliding bar to rotate the chart in order to align the bottom to the way you are looking.
When you are done, you can hit the back button and it will take you to the main menu to try out a new month.
